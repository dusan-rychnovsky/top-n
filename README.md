# Top N Elements

Sample code for my [blog article](http://blog.dusanrychnovsky.cz/2016/12/top-n-elements.html). 

Contains a Java based implementation of an efficient algorithm for selecting the first N elements
of a very large collection, according to some user-defined criterion. It is based on the Heap
data-structure (the PriorityQueue class in JDK).
